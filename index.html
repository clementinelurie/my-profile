				<p>
				 I am a 3rd year student in a business school: IESEG School of Management and I love travelling and dicovering new cultures. I lived in different countries and it helped me discover myself. We should all be open to new experiences and discover new things  ✈️ 🌏

<h2> Family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧</h2>
<p> Being around the people I love is the most important thing for me. In fact, I am verry social and like to meet my friends and go out often. Unfortunately my family live far away but I try to visit them as often as possible.  </p>

	<h2> Travel 🌏</h2>
		<p> Like I said in my bio, travelling is one of my favorite things to do. Thanks to my parents who love travelling I was able to discover amazing countries and cultures from a young age. Now I try to travel at least once every two months. In fact I don't like to stay put in one place to long so travelling helps me breath and get out of my confort zone.</p>
